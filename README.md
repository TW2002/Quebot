## What is Quebot?

In quantum computing, a qubit (/ˈkjuːbɪt/) or quantum bit is the basic unit of quantum information. In [TradeWars 2002 (TW2002)](http://www.eisonline.com) **Quebot** simplies gameplay by automating common tasks such as colonizing, cashing, and much much more. By using the deaf feature of [TWXProxy Script (TS)](https://github.com/MicroBlaster/TWXProxy/wiki/Scripting-Reference), **Quebot** is able to give you enhanced displays and usefull information without tons of text flying by at high speed.

**Quebot** is writen as an C# extention to [TWX3](https://github.com/TW2002/TWXP/).

**Quebot** can run you favorite [Mombot](https://github.com/MicroBlaster/TWXProxy/wiki/Mombot-Reference) scripts, which allows me to focus on improving in areas not already covered by the public version of [Mombot](https://github.com/MicroBlaster/TWXProxy/wiki/Mombot-Reference).

**Quebot** is a FREE and [open source](https://github.com/TW2002/Quebot/) automatron written in [TWXProxy Script (TS)](https://github.com/MicroBlaster/TWXProxy/wiki/Scripting-Reference) and relased under the [MIT license](https://github.com/TW2002/Quebot/blob/master/LICENSE).

For further information, please visit the [Quebot Reference](https://github.com/MicroBlaster/TWXProxy/wiki/Quebot-Reference) section of the [TWX Proxy 2.6 WIKI](https://github.com/MicroBlaster/TWXProxy/wiki).

**Quantum Quebot** is the first bot written in C#, and does not actually contain code written by other developers, but I would like to give credit to anyone who directly or indirectly influenced development of scripts and/or concepts used in **Quebot**:
