## What is Qubot?

In quantum computing, a qubit (/ˈkjuːbɪt/) or quantum bit is the basic unit of quantum information. In [TradeWars 2002 (TW2002)](http://www.eisonline.com) **Qubot** simplies gameplay by automating common tasks such as colonizing, cashing, and much much more. By using the deaf feature of [TWXProxy Script (TS)](https://github.com/MicroBlaster/TWXProxy/wiki/Scripting-Reference), **Qubot** is able to give you enhanced displays and usefull information without tons of text flying by at high speed.

**Qubot** is writen as an C# extention to [TWX3](https://github.com/TW2002/TWXP/).

**Qubot** can run you favorite [Mombot](https://github.com/MicroBlaster/TWXProxy/wiki/Mombot-Reference) scripts, which allows me to focus on improving in areas not already covered by the public version of [Mombot](https://github.com/MicroBlaster/TWXProxy/wiki/Mombot-Reference).

**Qubot** is a FREE and [open source](https://github.com/TW2002/Qubot/) automatron written in [TWXProxy Script (TS)](https://github.com/MicroBlaster/TWXProxy/wiki/Scripting-Reference) and relased under the [MIT license](https://github.com/TW2002/Qubot/blob/master/LICENSE).

For further information, please visit the [Qubot Reference](https://github.com/MicroBlaster/TWXProxy/wiki/Qubot-Reference) section of the [TWX Proxy 2.6 WIKI](https://github.com/MicroBlaster/TWXProxy/wiki).
